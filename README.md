# Homepage Changer
Browser extension that changes your homepage to weekly top-ranked posts from a subreddit of your choosing.
Type whatever subreddit you wish (without the 'r/') and hit next. Back to go back, cover to enlarge the image as applicable to cover the entire window. Nothing else to say really.

Note that your virtual "position" of sort, will carry over between subreddits, e.g if you're on the 7th top weekly on r/ImaginarySliceofLife and you switch to r/art, you'll be on the 7th top weekly of r/art instead of starting from 1st.
