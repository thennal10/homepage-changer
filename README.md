# Newtab Changer
Browser extension that changes your homepage to top-rated image posts from any subreddit of your choosing

Click on the options to bring up the menue. Type in a subreddit (without the 'r/') and hit enter to see the results. Click on the preview options to make it your default newtab. Click on the toggle in the popup if you don't want the image container and would rather just have an enlarged image covering the whole screen.

Not much else to say, really.
